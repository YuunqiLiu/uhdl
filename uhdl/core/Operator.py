        rhs default   - UInt/SInt(v)

    select is the selection signal.

    casepair can be either:
    1. A lookup table organized as a list of tuples. Each tuple expresses a mapping relationship.
       When sel equals the first value in the tuple, the output is the second value of the tuple.
    2. A dictionary where keys are selection values and values are corresponding outputs.
       When sel equals a key, the output is the corresponding value.

    default is the default output value of the circuit. 
    When sel does not match any item in the lookup table, the circuit will output this value.
    
    The return value of this function is 
    
        rhs O - UInt/SInt(v)

    Typical examples:

    Using list of tuples:
        O += Case(sel,[(UInt(2,0),Ares),(UInt(2,1),Bres)],DFTres)

    Using dictionary:
        O += Case(sel,{UInt(2,0):Ares, UInt(2,1):Bres}, DFTres)

    Both examples correspond to the same behavior: 

        case(sel)
        2'b0:       O = Ares
        2'b1:       O = Bres
        default:    O = DFTres
        endcase

    select and the first value of tuple in casepair list must have the same attributes, that is, all UInt(k) or SInt(k).

    default and the second value of tuple in casepair list mus have the sam attributss, that is, all UInt(v) or SInt(v).
